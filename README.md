# Superheroes-API
At the YE2019 Superheroes API - https://superheroapi.com/ - had 732 heroes from different universes: DC, Marvel etc. 

Tried to figure out the most powerful by the total sum of their stats and guess what? Gods are the most powerful, what a surprise!:) With 600/600 possible points winners are:

* Man of Miracles (first mentioned in the Spawn #75) and 
* One-Above-All (first mentioned in the Fantastic Four Vol 1 511).

There is still a lot of work to do: who's the most powerful among different genders, species etc., however that is smth to be implemented somewhat later.
